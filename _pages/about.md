I'm How-Shing Wang, a second-year master's student majoring in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. My interests lie in ML systems, spanning from cloud infrastructure to performant GPU kernels. Currently, I am studying compilers and GPU architecture to gain a more holistic view of the entire ML system stack.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to J-Pop, watching Netflix, playing tennis, and sometimes creating content on Threads. Unfortunately, as a grad student, I don't have much of it!
